The popfile, the vscript files `oz_terror.nut` and `lobo_core.nut`, the overlays and the sound file `tranquility.wav` (just a mashup of two stock TF2 SFXs) are all my own work.
You are free to use or modify them however you want. You do not need to worry for credit.
I only ask for a little mention in the description or something.

I cannot say the same for the other assets not listed above, though. Please ask the individual creators listed at the start of the popfile.
